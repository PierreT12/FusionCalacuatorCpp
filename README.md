# FusionCalculatorCpp
A remake of my [C# Fusion Calculator](https://github.com/PierreT12/FusionCalcCSharpRedux).

This is a Personal Project that I was working on in C# but I needed to transfer over to C++ for my Graduate School Portfolio.  
Because most of the logic has already been written in C#, I just took that and implemented it in C++ and cleaned it up. All of the information relating to Personas is stored within a SQLite Database.  

I've put more of my time into this project rather than my C# one.  
So please look at this one if you want to see a good repesentation of my work!      

I'm self taught as of right now, but I will be taking a class in Spring 2021! 

# SQLite Database
The database I made was too large to be uploaded to Github in its SQLite form.  
So I exported a pictureless version to CSV pages so people can actually see what it looks like.   

 
Rather than just using Json files for the whole thing, I used a database for a few reasons. Mainly to to display how I could have it interact with my application as well as, actually creating the calcuation part of the program.
