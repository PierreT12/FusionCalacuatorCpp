# FusionCalacuatorCpp
A remake of my C# Fusion Calcuator.

This is a persona project that I was working on in C# but I needed to transfer over to C++ for my Graduate School Application.  
Because most of the logic has already been written in C#, I just took that and impletented it in C++ and cleaned it up. All of the information relating to Personas is stored within a SQLite Database.
