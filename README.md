# FusionCalculatorCpp
A remake of my [C# Fusion Calculator](https://github.com/PierreT12/FusionCalculatorCSharp).

This is a Personal Project that I was working on in C# but I needed to transfer over to C++ for my Graduate School Portfolio.  
Because most of the logic has already been written in C#, I just took that and implemented it in C++ and cleaned it up. All of the information relating to Personas is stored within a SQLite Database.  

Also please I apologize in advance if I make some common mistakes in C++. I'm self taught as of right now, but I will be taking a class in Spring 2021!  

# SQLite Database
The database I made was too large to be uploaded to Github in its SQLite form.  
So I exported a pictureless version to CSV pages so people can actually see what it looks like.  

# Current Features

Loads in images properly for each persona

I might not do this, from what I understand, the results can be pretty random. If I have the time I'll give it a shot.
